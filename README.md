# 6.390_Implement
Implement code of equations, models in 6.390: Introduction to Machine Learning (Spring 2024)

## Edited January 11st 2025:
This repo initially used for practicing implement models in lessons from course 6.390
However, I would like to challenge myself.
So I will try to implement other things as well, including, of course, machine learning and deep learning stuff that stay in the scope of the course.
